# ☁️ How I Setup Infrastructure

> Welcome to the kingdom where my apps live, thrive(?), and occasionally catch fire.  
> This is my **production playground**: a mix of self-hosting, cloud dabbling, and pure chaos engineering.
> Personally, I don’t like to depend *too much* on cloud tools.  
> If it can run on bare metal, I’ll probably try it because there’s something deeply satisfying about being the cloud myself ☁️👑.  

## 🖥️ [Servers: DigitalOcean Droplets]  
- My little droplets in the cloud ☁️.  
- Think of them as tiny apartments where all my apps crash the couch.  
- On top of them, I run a **k3s cluster** (because Kubernetes, but diet).  

## 🐋 [Containers Everywhere}  
- All my services get packed into **Docker containers**,  
  because nothing says “portable” like shipping an app in a box.  
- Plus, if something explodes, I can just yeet the container and pretend it never happened.  

## 📬 [Message Broker]  
- **RabbitMQ**: The mailman of my microservices.  
  Keeps everything chatting nicely without screaming into the void.  

## 🗄️ [Databases]  
- **SQL Server**: When I want a cloud-level grown-up database.  
- **SQLite**: When I just need something local and lightweight,  
  like a fast-food snack instead of a five-course meal.  

## 🌐 [Proxy]  
- **NGINX**: My trusty bouncer at the club door.  
  Decides who gets in, who gets redirected, and who gets thrown out.  

## 🤖 [CI/CD]  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates my “git push and pray” workflow.  
  It’s like having a robot intern that actually does its job.  

## 📈 [Logging & Monitoring]  
- **Grafana Loki**: Lets me watch logs flow in like the Matrix code,  
  except instead of saving the world, I’m just debugging why the API hates me.  

## ☁️ [Cloud Adventures (a.k.a. “I Dabbled…”)]  
Ok so, I lied.. Sometimes I cave and put on my AWS explorer hat and wander into some of their services.  
Here's a list of a few I've dabbled in:  
- **SQS**
- **SNS**
- **EventBridge**
- **EC2** 
- **ECR**
- **EKS**
- **ELB**
- **Terraform**
