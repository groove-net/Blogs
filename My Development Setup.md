# 🛠️ Totally Productive™ Development Setup  

> **Warning**: You are about to venture into my dev setup.  
> What follows is a dangerously optimized environment, powered by caffeine, duct tape, and command-line sorcery.

## 💻 [Computer Specs]  
- **Microsoft Surface Laptop 3**  
  - Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G7 @ 1.20GHz  
  - Cores: 4 physical, 8 logical
  - RAM: 8 GB  

## 🐧 [Operating System]  
- **Arch Linux 6.16.9**: Because I like my systems like my code—minimal, fast, and only broken when I say so.  

## ✍️ [Text Editor(s)]  
- **NeoVim**: For when I want to cosplay as a 10x engineer and pretend I know what I’m doing with keybindings.  
- **VS Code**: For when I realize I *don’t* know what I’m doing and would like pretty colors and friendly buttons, please.  

Basically, I swap between them like someone who can’t decide which Netflix show to commit to but these days I tend to use NeoVim a lot more often.  

## 🐚 [Shell]  
- **bash**: Old reliable. Not the fastest, not the fanciest, but it works.  

## ⚡ [Command Line Tools]  
An ever-changing collection of command line tools that I find useful on a daily basis or just fun to play with from time to time.

Because JSON is fun… said no one ever.

<details>
<summary>🧭 zoxide</summary>
An efficient replacement for `cd`. It remembers the directories you've been in, so you can more easily jump to them next time. Say you do `cd ~/.local/share/omarchy` once. Next time, you can just do `cd omarchy` (or even just `cd oma`), and Zoxide will take you directly there.

<summary>📁 eza</summary>
A fancy replacement for `ls`. It gives you directory listings with more information, color, and icons. In my setup, eza has been aliased as `ls`. I can also use `lt` to get a listing of two-deep levels of nesting. `lsa` gives me a listing including hidden files. And `lta` a nested listing with hidden files.

<summary>⚡ fastfetch</summary>
Fastfetch shows system information, like kernel version, uptime, theme, CPU, memory, and more. It's a successor to the popular neofetch tool.

<details>
<summary>📺 tmux</summary>
A multiplexer. Translation: allows me to feel like a hacker in a movie, splitting my terminal into way too many panes that I immediately forget about.
